## Description
This project is an business management application that allows a user to interact with a mysql database that includes departments, roles and employees that exist in the company. The application is built using `Nodejs`, `Inquirer`, `console.table` and `mysql`.

When a user starts the application, they are presented with a series of prompts, ranging from viewing database information to changing or deleting information. 

![prompts](./Assets/prompts.png)

After selecting a prompt, the application will handle the user request by querying the database and returning the data in a `console.table` command for easy reading. An example output is below:

![output](./Assets/output.png)

After the output is returned, the application will provide the user with another opportunity to select a new way to interact with the database - the same way that the user is prompted when the application is first started.

When the user is done with the applications, they can exit using the command `control + c`.

All of the base acceptance criteia has been met, along with 5 bonus criteria: Budget per department, delete department, delete role, delete employee, view employees by department.
